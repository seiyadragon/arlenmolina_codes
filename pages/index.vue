            I'm finally starting to grow an audience, 
            but I'm looking to expand my business with 
            my own website. I want a beautiful site, 
            that helps me grow my business both in terms 
            of money as well as attracting new customers. 
            How can I make this happen?

            I'm a programmer with several years of experience. I started
            at the age of 14, around the time I was in 8th grade. I really
            liked to play videogames, and decided to make some. And that's 
            how my story begins.
          "
          response-two="
            Since that time I've worked on many web
            projects, both front-end and back-end. I am profficient in several
            programming languages and frameworks, as well as SEO, and social
            media management. Fun fact, I was born in Cuba y tambien se hablar 
            EspaÃ±ol. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡º
